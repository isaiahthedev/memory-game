# Memory Game

## To Do
- [x] initialize index, style, and script files
- [x] create the game board and fill it with 9 tiles of 3 colors
- [ ] create a play button
- [ ] create a header that will say "3...,2...,1..." on a timer when the game starts
- [ ] make it so that when the timer reaches 0 the colors all change to one color
- [ ] make it so when the player clicks on a square the original color is revealed
- [ ] make it so if the player clicks the wrong color they lose a life (they'll have 3 lives)
- [ ] make it so if the player matches all the tiles they're points increment and the tiles are randomized and the countdown starts again
- [ ] if the player loses all their lives, the game is over
- [ ] display how many points the player got and a "play again?" button
